First repository for Intro Projects

03/19/20- I've created my first repository (that is code-speak for a place to store files) on GitHub. This is where I'll be storing all of my APCSP work and we'll be using the readme for our reflections. Apparently, there is a process for saving that is not as straight forward as File, Save, or auto-save, as we know it these days.

Saving your work/updates involves something called a "commit", where you are committing the changes to the file(s). You have to add a comment to a commit so you, or other collaborators, can look back, and know what you did each step of the way. For now, we will be committing directly to the master branch (the branch that's the master- for real life, or the live version).

That's it for now!
